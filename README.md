# Introduction

This repository is a home for snippets, tips and tricks and examples
of scripting for the [Jenkins Workflow plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

# Layout

Please put your script into its own directory, with a README.md file
included explaining what your script does or shows. Make sure your
script is commented so that others can understand how it works, why it
works, etc.

# License

All contributions are under the MIT license, like Jenkins itself.

# Pull requests

We want them!
